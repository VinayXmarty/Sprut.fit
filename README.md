# App.jsx

I setup the react router dom i.e the navigation

# The home page

Transistions - loading transistion with gasp , the blue 100 vh slowly dispapears sliding up and then the text comes up with y axis transistion same goes for the image

# Menu 

the toggle effect was simple the main task was the picture everytime i hover on the links the images change one by one

# Contact form

simple form with beautiful css the transition here was magnetic button. With gasp it traces the path of the mouse 

# Footer

Simple css


# About page

The custom marquee from react and accordin from react made things easy and alignment of page makes it look better , it took me time to find perfect fonts


# Tools page

the hover animation on image picture makes the image appear as background i.e blurred which gives a very good look to page

# Finally single tool page

this is my favourite animation whenevr i hover on the next tool text the image of tools floats along with the mouse
